For normal operation, tie LT' and BL' to +5 V (active-low, so HIGH = disabled, meaning lamp test and blanking are both off). Tie LE to GND (latch enable LOW = transparent latch, output follows input). Connect the four BCD inputs A (pin 7), B (pin 1), C (pin 2), D (pin 6) to their respective switches.",
