    'A half-wave rectifier converts an alternating current (AC) input into a pulsating direct current (DC) output by allowing current to flow through the load during only one half-cycle of the input waveform.',
    'The diode D1 is forward biased during the positive half-cycle of the AC input, conducting and dropping roughly $0.7\\,V$ across itself (for a silicon diode). During the negative half-cycle, D1 is reverse biased and blocks conduction, so no current flows through the load $R_L$.',
    'For a sinusoidal input with peak voltage $V_m$, the average (DC) output voltage across the load, ignoring the diode forward drop, is $V_{dc} = \\dfrac{V_m}{\\pi} \\approx 0.318\\,V_m$.',
    'The raw rectified output still contains a large AC ripple component, since current flows only for half of each cycle. Adding a filter capacitor $C_1$ in parallel with $R_L$ charges during conduction and discharges through $R_L$ when the diode is reverse biased, smoothing the output and raising the effective $V_{dc}$ closer to $V_m$.',
    'The ripple factor $r = \\dfrac{V_{r(rms)}}{V_{dc}}$ quantifies the residual AC content in the filtered output; a larger filter capacitance or load resistance reduces ripple by slowing the capacitor\u2019s discharge between conduction pulses.',
