    'The half-wave rectifier successfully converted the AC input into a pulsating DC output, conducting only during the positive half-cycle when D1 was forward biased.',
    'Adding the filter capacitor $C_1$ in parallel with the load significantly raised the measured $V_{dc}$ and visibly reduced ripple, confirming the capacitor\u2019s charge/discharge smoothing action.',
    'The measured DC output without filtering agreed closely with the theoretical prediction $V_{dc} = V_m/\\pi$, within the expected error introduced by the diode\u2019s forward voltage drop.',
