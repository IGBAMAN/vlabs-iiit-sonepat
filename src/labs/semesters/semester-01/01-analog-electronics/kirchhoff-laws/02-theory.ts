    "Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL): the algebraic sum of all potential differences around any closed loop is zero "
      + '($\\sum V = 0$). This follows from conservation of energy — a charge carrier traversing a closed loop '
      + 'returns to its starting potential.',

    'Together KCL and KVL form the foundation for mesh analysis, nodal analysis, superposition, '
