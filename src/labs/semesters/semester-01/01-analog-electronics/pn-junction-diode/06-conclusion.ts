    'The V-I characteristics of the 1N4148 PN junction diode were successfully plotted for both forward and reverse bias. '
      + 'The forward characteristic exhibited the expected exponential rise beyond $V_{th} \\approx 0.65\\,\\text{V}$, confirming the Shockley diode equation.',

    'The dynamic resistance calculated from the forward characteristic slope agreed with the theoretical $r_d = nkT/qI$. '
      + 'In reverse bias, leakage current was below DMM resolution, confirming blocking behaviour.',

    'This experiment establishes a clear understanding of diode non-linearity, threshold voltage, '
      + 'and the difference between ideal and real diode behaviour — fundamentals for rectifier, clipping, and clamping circuit design.',
