    "Norton's Theorem: any linear two-terminal network can be replaced by a current source $I_N$ (short-circuit current between the terminals) in parallel with resistance $R_N$ (same as $R_{th}$).",
    "Norton's and Thevenin's theorems are dual representations. They are related by source transformation: $V_{th} = I_N \\cdot R_N$ and $R_{th} = R_N$.",
    'To find $I_N$ experimentally: short-circuit the output terminals A-B with an ammeter and measure $I_{sc} = I_N$. To find $R_N$: kill sources and measure resistance at A-B.',
    "In this experiment $I_N$ and $R_N$ are measured experimentally, the Norton equivalent is constructed, and load voltages are compared with the original network. The relationship $I_N = V_{th}/R_{th}$ is also confirmed.",
