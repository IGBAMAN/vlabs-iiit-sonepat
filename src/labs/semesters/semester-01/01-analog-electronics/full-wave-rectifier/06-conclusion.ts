    'The full-wave bridge rectifier successfully converted the AC input into a pulsating DC output by using all four diodes to conduct on both half-cycles, giving a higher average output voltage and twice the ripple frequency compared to a half-wave rectifier.',
    'Adding the filter capacitor significantly reduced the ripple in the output, producing a much steadier DC voltage suitable for powering DC loads — demonstrating the combined role of rectification and filtering in a basic DC power supply.',
