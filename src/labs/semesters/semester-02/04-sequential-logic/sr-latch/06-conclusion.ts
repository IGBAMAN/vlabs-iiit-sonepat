    "The SR latch constructed using the 74HC279 IC demonstrated all four operating states: Set (Q=1), Reset (Q=0), Hold (Q unchanged), and the Forbidden state (Q=Q_bar=1).",
    "The memory property was verified: once set or reset, the latch maintained its state with both inputs HIGH — confirming bistable operation without a clock.",
    "The SR latch is the building block of all sequential elements. Its active-LOW inputs and forbidden state are its key characteristics that motivate the more robust D and JK flip-flops.",
