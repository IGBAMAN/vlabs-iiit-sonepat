  body: "With I permanently tied HIGH, simulate a bus conflict scenario by momentarily connecting both AND gate inputs to HIGH manually (if feasible in the gate-level build). In a real system this cannot occur because only one address is valid at a time. Discuss how the enable input (I) of a practical 74HC139 DEMUX is used as an additional layer of control — asserting the enable signal only during valid address cycles prevents glitches from activating wrong devices during address transitions.",
